# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To perform a heuristic evaluation of existing social media applications and compare their user experience.
To analyze the UX of Instagram and Snapchat and propose improved design changes using UX principles and A/B testing methods.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Algorithm:

1. Select and Compare Competitor Apps/Websites

   1.1 Selected competitors: Instagram and Snapchat.
   1.2 Observed their core features such as stories, messaging, content feed, and navigation.
   1.3 Compared navigation structure, layout clarity, and interaction models.
   1.4 Noted that Instagram uses structured bottom navigation and feed-based discovery.
   1.5 Observed that Snapchat uses gesture-based navigation and a camera-first interface.
   1.6 Identified differences in feature visibility and user control.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Perform Heuristic Evaluation

   2.1 Evaluated both apps using Nielsen’s usability heuristics.
   2.2 Checked visibility of system status (upload indicators, message seen status).
   2.3 Evaluated consistency and standards in navigation and icons.
   2.4 Analyzed user control and freedom in navigation.
   2.5 Reviewed aesthetic and minimalist design principles.
   2.6 Identified usability gaps in both platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Analyze and Document Findings

   3.1 Documented strengths and weaknesses of Instagram.
   3.2 Documented strengths and weaknesses of Snapchat.
   3.3 Observed that Instagram provides better visibility and standard navigation patterns.
   3.4 Noted that Snapchat has a steep learning curve due to gesture-based controls.
   3.5 Identified issues like content overload in Instagram and unclear navigation in Snapchat.
   3.6 Collected observations related to engagement, usability, and accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Propose and Apply Improvements

   4.1 Proposed feed personalization toggle for Instagram (Following / Suggested).
   4.2 Suggested reducing reel dominance to improve content clarity.
   4.3 Recommended improved spacing and hierarchy for Instagram home feed.
   4.4 Proposed adding optional visible navigation indicators in Snapchat.
   4.5 Suggested tooltips for first-time users in Snapchat.
   4.6 Recommended improving content grouping in the Discover section.
   4.7 Redesigned selected screens in Figma to reflect proposed improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Output:

# Instagram

------------------------------------------------------------

## Heuristic Evaluation – Instagram and Snapchat

1. A heuristic evaluation was conducted to compare the UX of Instagram and Snapchat.
2. Both platforms focus on visual storytelling and real-time interaction.
3. Instagram provides clear navigation and consistent UI patterns.
4. However, Instagram’s home feed contains excessive suggested content and reels.
5. Snapchat offers a minimal interface but relies heavily on gestures.
6. New users may find Snapchat difficult to navigate due to hidden features.
7. Instagram performs better in visibility of system status.
8. Snapchat performs well in minimalist camera-first design.
9. Both apps demonstrate strong engagement models but require usability refinement.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Proposed Improvements – Redesigned Version

1. The redesigned Instagram feed includes a content toggle for better personalization.
2. Reel content is grouped separately to reduce feed overload.
3. Visual hierarchy is improved using spacing and structured content blocks.
4. The redesigned Snapchat interface includes subtle navigation hints.
5. Onboarding tooltips are added for first-time users.
6. Discover page layout is simplified with clearer content sections.
7. Improved accessibility with better contrast and readable font sizing.
8. Reduced cognitive load by limiting excessive feature visibility.
9. Redesigned layouts were created in Figma for comparison.
10. The improved designs focus on clarity, usability, and reduced user confusion.

------------------------------------------------------------

## A/B Testing Evaluation

Version A – Original Interface
Version B – Redesigned Interface

Metrics Evaluated:

1. Task completion time
2. User navigation errors
3. Engagement rate
4. Session duration
5. Feature discovery rate

Expected Impact:

1. Improved clarity leads to faster task completion.
2. Better navigation reduces user errors.
3. Reduced cognitive overload increases session duration.
4. Clear content grouping improves engagement rate.
5. Enhanced onboarding increases feature discovery.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Result:

The heuristic evaluation of Instagram and Snapchat was successfully conducted.
Design gaps were identified and improved using UX principles.
The proposed redesign demonstrates improved usability, better navigation clarity, and enhanced user experience validated through A/B testing methods.
